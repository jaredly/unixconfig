# Files List for Fedora Mirror
#
# From the rsync man page:
#
# "As the list of files/directories to transfer is built, rsync checks
# each name to be transferred against the list of include/exclude patterns
# in turn, and the first matching pattern is acted on."
#
# So if both an include pattern and an exclude pattern match, then the
# exclude pattern should be listed first.
